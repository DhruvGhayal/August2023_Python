#PRACTICE EXAMPLE 1
multiplier = 1
result = multiplier*5
while result <= 50:
  print(result)
  multiplier += 1
  result = multiplier*5
print("Done")
# This while loop prints the multiples of 5 between 1 and 50. The
# "multiplier" variable is initialized with the starting value of 1. 
# The "result" variable is initialized with the value of the 
# "multiplier" variable times 5. 
# The while loop specifies that the loop must iterate while it is True 
# that the "result" is less than or equal to 50. Within the while loop, 
# the code tells the Python interpreter to print the value of the 
# "result" variable. Then, the "multiplier" is incremented by 1 and the
# "result" is assigned the new value of the "multiplier" times 5. 
# The end of the while loop is indicated by the indentation of the next 
# line of code moving one tab to the left. At this point, the Python
# interpreter automatically loops back to the beginning of the while
# loop to check the condition again with the new value of the "result"
# variable. When the while loop condition becomes False (meaning
# "result" is no longer less than or equal to 50), the interpreter exits
# the loop and reads the next line of code outside of the loop. In this 
# case, that next line tells the interpreter to print the string "Done". 
# Click the "Run" button to check the result of this while loop.

#PRACTICE EXAMPLE
# This function outputs an addition table. It is written to end after
# printing 5 lines of the addition table, but it will break out of the
# loop if the "my_sum" variable exceeds 20. 
 
# The function accepts a "given_number" variable through its 
# parameters.
def addition_table(given_number):
    # The "iterated_number" and "my_sum" variables are initialized with
    # the value of 1. Although the "my_sum" variable does not need any
    # specific initial value, it still must be assigned a data type
    # before being used in the while loop. By initializing "my_sum"
    # with any integer, the data type will be set to int.
    iterated_number = 1
    my_sum = 1
    # The while loop will run while it is True that the   
    # "iterated_number" is less than or equal to 5.
    while iterated_number <= 5:
        # The "my_sum" variable is assigned the value of the
        # "given_number" plus the "iterated_number" variables.
        my_sum = given_number + iterated_number
        # Test to see if the "my_sum" variable is greater than 20.
        if my_sum > 20:
            # If True, then use the break keyword to exit the loop. 
            break
        # If False, the Python interpreter will move to the next line 
        # in the while loop after the if-statement has ended.  
 
        # The print function will output the "given_number" plus
        # the "iterated_number" equals "my_sum".
        print(str(given_number), "+", str(iterated_number), "=", str(my_sum))
 
        # Increment the "iterated_number" before the while loop starts
        # over again to print a new "my_sum" value.
        iterated_number += 1
